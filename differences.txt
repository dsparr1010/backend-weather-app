Why... Why is it that we feel the need to come up with a diagnosis for every minor and major differences in personality?
I'm a scatterbrained, disorganized, and somewhat detached person. Now those qualities are not 
a good fit in all roles - I get that. BUT, have you ever thought about the positive side of your 'weaknesses'?
I'm scatterbrained because I have very high mental energy and I tend to, in a completely natural and passive manner, 
analyze, examine, and investigate anything and everything. As a positive, I've found that I can 
recognize patterns with more ease.
With that in mind, the same part of my brain that is inclined to disorder allows me to make sense 
of a chaotic environment, adapt quickly to changes, and keep an open mind. It's amazing what you can do
when you're not stuck on the right way and the wrong way to do a thing. 
I don't even write on lined papaer anymore. It's too restrictive.
Which brings me to my last "flaw" - detached! When someone comes to me with a problem, 
I immediately go to breaking down the problem at hand and attempting different 
approaches to solving it. That being said, I'm not exactly a source of emotional comfort and solace.
When tackling a problem, I remove myself from it - even with my own problems! This allows me to look 
at things objectively and honestly.


We all know the phrase "There's good and bad in all of us" but in the case of personality flaws, 
that depends on the observer.
